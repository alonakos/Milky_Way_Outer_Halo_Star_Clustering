Milky Way Outer Halo Star Clustering: Solving The Missing Satellite Galaxy Problem


Description and Objectives: 


Our project aims to address the Missing Satellite Galaxy Problem by identifying clusters of stars in the Milky Way's outer halo using the Gaia Data Archive. We plan to use the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to detect groups of stars moving together. By analyzing these groups, we hope to uncover evidence of satellite dwarf galaxy mergers with the Milky Way, providing further support for the Lambda-CDM model of Universe evolution.
